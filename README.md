## Work Experience

### GE Vernova, Toronto, ON

**Software Engineer**  
*Oct 2022 – July 2025*

- Deployed a role-based access control (RBAC) system using Kubernetes and Istio to ensure secure access management within a microservices architecture.
- Built an adapter that integrates with GE ADMS to publish Bus Load Allocation (BLA) data to Kafka, improving data quality and optimization analysis convergence.
- Conducted a Minimum Viable Load Test on the DERMS product, monitoring performance against customer NFRs with Grafana, ArgoCD, and Kiali to establish performance benchmarks.
- Implemented high-availability architecture on the Optimization module to ensure fault tolerance and distributivity.
- Led technical debt and team prioritization initiatives, enhancing system maintainability and development workflows.
- Designed and trained a deep neural network approximation of the Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) optimal scheduling solver, demonstrating better speed and comparable accuracy to the analytical solution.
- Optimized network model correction performance by 20% by analyzing and refactoring performance bottlenecks.
- Built a powerflow comparison tool that calculates Voltage vs. Feeder Distance and Per-Phase Power statistics and compares results between GE ADMS and the GridOS Optimization Engine.
