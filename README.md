## Work Experience

### GE Vernova, Toronto, ON

**Software Engineer**  
*Feb 2023 ‚Äì July 2025*

- Developed a real-time power and controls visualization dashboard using Chart.js, Angular, and Kafka.
- Deployed a role-based access control (RBAC) system using Kubernetes and Istio to ensure secure access management within a microservices architecture.
- Built an adapter that integrates with GE ADMS to publish Bus Load Allocation (BLA) data to Kafka, improving data quality and optimization analysis convergence.
- Conducted a Minimum Viable Load Test on the DERMS product, monitoring performance against customer NFRs with Grafana, ArgoCD, and Kiali to establish performance benchmarks.
- Implemented high-availability architecture on the Optimization module to ensure fault tolerance and distributivity.
- Led technical debt and team prioritization initiatives, enhancing system maintainability and development workflows.
- Designed and trained a deep neural network approximation of the Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) optimal scheduling solver, demonstrating better speed and comparable accuracy to the analytical solution.

**Software Developer - Network Modelling**  
*Oct 2022 ‚Äì Feb 2023*

- Optimized network model correction performance by 20% by analyzing and refactoring performance bottlenecks.
- Built a powerflow comparison tool that calculates Voltage vs. Feeder Distance and Per-Phase Power statistics and compares results between GE ADMS and the GridOS Optimization Engine.

### INEO Solutions Inc., Langley, BC

**R&D Engineering Co-op**  
*May 2021 ‚Äì Aug 2021*

- Developed FPGA infrastructure to interface with external hardware using VHDL, such as EEPROM, ADC, and PLL using VHDL and ModelSim ME.
